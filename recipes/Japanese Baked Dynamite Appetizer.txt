Ingredients
1 14-oz bag frozen mixed seafood 
(calamari, mussels, baby squid, shrimp, imitation crab)
1 package of white button mushrooms 
(stems removed, sliced)
3/4 to 1 cup light mayonnaise 
(Best Foods), enough to evenly coat seafood and mushrooms 
(add more for creamier and richer texture)
2 tablespoons masago caviar 
(plus optional 2 tablespoons for garnish)

Steps to Make It

1) Heat oven to 375 F.

2) Line muffin pan with aluminum foil cups.

3) In a medium pot, bring water to boil, reduce heat and simmer frozen 
seafood for 10 minutes or until cooked through. Drain and allow it to cool slightly.

4) In a small pan, sauté sliced mushrooms to remove excess water. 
Allow the mushrooms to cool to room temperature, 
and drain on a paper towel to remove excess water and moisture.

5) In a medium bowl, mix cooked seafood, cooked mushrooms, 
mayonnaise and masago. Mix gently until all ingredients are incorporated.

6) Gently scoop a small portion into each individual aluminum foil cup.

7)Bake for 15 minutes or until the tops of the dynamite is browned.
 As an option, during the last 2 to 3 minutes the oven setting may 
be changed to low broil to quickly brown the tops of the dynamite cups.

*If using fresh seafood, there is no need to
 pre-cook the seafood (as in step #3 for frozen seafood), 
bake dynamite for 20 minutes until the seafood is cooked through.

8) Garnish the tops of each dynamite cup with a touch 
of additional masago for added color and flavor.

Tip
You can skip the step for sautéeing the mushrooms 
altogether and fresh mushrooms can be baked with 
the dynamite mixture, but the end result will be 
slightly watery due to the mushroom's moisture content.
