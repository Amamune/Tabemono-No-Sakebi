Ingredients
10 ounces HemisFares Soba Air-Dried Buckwheat Noodles
1/3 cup HemisFares Double Fermented Soy Sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 cups green onions chopped in 1/4-inch pieces
1/2 cup green onions minced
3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

Instructions

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook 
the soba noodles for 4-5 minutes or just until tender, 
stirring occasionally so the noodles don't clump. 
Drain in a colander and rinse well under cold water, 
tossing to remove the starch. 

While the noodles are cooking, in a medium bowl, 
whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, 
sugar and black pepper. Set aside.

Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. 
Add the canola oil and heat until shimmering 
then add the chopped green onions. Cook, stirring, 
for 15 to 30 seconds or until fragrant.

Add the soy and sesame mixture and cook for 30 seconds,
 Add the noodles and toss until the noodles are heated through.
 Add the remaining minced green onion and half of the sesame seeds.
 Garnish with the remaining seeds and serve warm or at room temperature.
